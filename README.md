# Snake Game

This is just a mini project to learn JavaScript's classes and module system.

## Features suggested by my friends: 
- [x] Dark mode support 
- [ ] Special sound effects. *To be released in version 2.0.0*
- [ ] Mobile support. *To be released in version 2.0.0*

***
I'm planning to migrate this project to TypeScript, because I believe that adding static types would make the code more readable and robust.
